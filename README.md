# Navee GazeTracking project

## Adhd focus software prototype

For my biomedical design course we worked with this gaze tracking library to create a prototype of how gaze tracking technology could help people with distractability symptoms focus on evreyday tasks. 

Its use is simple, the camera tracks you eye movements for around the time of a pomodoro tracker. Everytime your pupils are not detected for longer than certain time, the software will issue a warning to remind you to focus on your work! Pretty simple huh? 

Files and its uses:

- navee_DEMO.py : short blocks of time to show the use of the software.
- navee.py : full software
- ProyectoFinal.ipynb: first try at the project(open at your own risk!)

If the software is not working properly. Refer to the calibration tab in the software menu to make sure that your space is well lit and that the camera has a good vision on your eyes.

We wanted to add more things, like different sound packages (leyend of zelda themed for example). Changes to time blocks, and more. But the project ended as a prototype, it grew bigger than what we could handle with our knowledge at the time.

Feel free to try and check it out :)

Thanks to  antoinelame for its great work in the gaze tracking library.
